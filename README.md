# Android Trending Github repos Challenge

## Overview
The task is to implement an app that will display Github most starred repos, the app
will fetch JSON data directly from the Github API.
It is not designed to be difficult, so be mindful of over-engineering your solution.
There is no strict time limit for the project, but we would expect that it wouldn't take
you more than a few hours to complete.
Requirements
● As a user, I should be able to list the most starred Github repos that were
created in the last 30 days.
● As a user, I should see the results presented as a vertical list. Each row
represents a repo.
● As a user, I should be able to see the repo name, description, stars count,
username and user avatar on each row.
● As a user, I should be able to keep scrolling and see new results coming up
(pagination).
